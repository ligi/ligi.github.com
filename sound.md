## 2021

Realized a scoop does not really fit on the long-john. OK it fits but you cannot really steer anymore.

So organized a build of a trailer from the [carla cargo plans](https://werkstatt-lastenrad.de/index.php?title=Bauanleitung_Carla_Cargo_Crowd#Lizenz) - much better fit for a scoop (or maybe 2).

I am about to document the sound in [the wiki](https://github.com/ligi/ligi.github.com/wiki/sound).

## 2020

I realized for better sound I need a bigger bike so I got a long-john from 1980. For now I just added the old system on there and just provided it with a better power supply (Liontron 80Ah@12.8V = 1024W/h = 1kWh ;)

But I need to get a scoop going on there soon.

## 2017

This was my first attempt. The bass roll is a magnat Power bull 300 and it is driven by a ptx500 monoblock.
